        <h1>First, the basics.</h1>

        <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Top 3 goals for the class.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gain experience with web development as a whole</li>
            <li>Learn new programming languages</li>
            <li>Learn about web development frameworks and terminology</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h1>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <emp>draw attention to something</emp> in a line of text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text</p>
        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong><emp>do both</emp></strong></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>Soft line break can't wrap anything.<br/>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
        <p>Add a hard line under here, and break the previous two lines using a soft break.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>
        
        <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

        <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>
        <img src='images/mochi.gif' width='75' alt='A dancing mochi ball'/>
        <img src='images/mochi.png' width='75' alt='A mochi ball'/>
        <img src='images/mochi.svg' alt='A mochi ball with Bezier handles'/>

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 

Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
